# ray-trace-in-weekend-python

This repo is my Python implemenetation of this project. I followed the book, translating into python as I went along, with some help from GitHub Copilot and a whole lot of digging into the Pyhon Docs. I have learned a lot about Ray Tracers and a lot about Python along the way.:

https://docs.python.org/3/contents.html

The project repo is "tagged" at each milestone, up until we got into Dielectric Material, where it all went very awry until I was able to sort it all out at the end. So, there are some steps in the book that didnt become tags. I just had to keep moving forward with the faith that I would find the solution to the problems along the way. So there was strife along the awy with success at the end - hence no tags of all the strife. I did, however, go back and re-render all of the images once I sorted things out (except 15 for reasons apparent in the book). On Github, its also possible to download the repo in its state at any given tag. Just click on the tags icon (next to branches icon). To see a list of tag names and their commit messages from the CLI, type this at terminal:

`git tag -n`

To view the state of the repo at that milestone type this at terminal:

`git checkout <tagname>`

To run the program simply type this at terminal, assuming you have python3 installed:

`python3 main.py`

Enjoy. What a fun and informative project!!!
